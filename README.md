# Network Security Monitoring and Incident Response Lab

## Overview

This repository contains my implementation of a comprehensive Network Security Monitoring and Incident Response lab environment using Docker containerization technology. The lab provides a practical platform for hands-on experience with security monitoring tools, log analysis, alert configuration, and incident response procedures in a controlled environment.

Traditional virtualized labs often present challenges such as high resource consumption, inconsistent environments, and complex configuration requirements. This Docker-based approach overcomes these limitations by providing a lightweight, consistent, and easily deployable environment that closely resembles real-world network security scenarios.

## Architecture

The lab architecture implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:



### Network Segmentation

The environment consists of two isolated networks:
- **Corporate Network (172.20.0.0/16)**: Contains internal resources including servers, workstations, and monitoring tools
- **DMZ Network (172.30.0.0/16)**: Contains the attacker machine and simulates the external network

### Key Components

1. **SIEM System**: Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
   - Elasticsearch: Data storage and search engine
   - Logstash: Log processing and normalization
   - Kibana: Visualization and dashboard interface

2. **Network Security Tools**:
   - Suricata IDS/IPS: Signature-based threat detection
   - Firewall: Network traffic control between corporate and DMZ networks

3. **Corporate Infrastructure**:
   - Corporate Server: Primary server with SSH and web services
   - Workstations: Employee simulation containers

4. **Security Testing Tools**:
   - Attacker Machine: Kali Linux container for simulating attacks
   - SOC Analyst Workstation: Security operations and incident response

## Implementation Modules

### Module 1: Identifying Key Monitoring Metrics

Focused on establishing meaningful security monitoring metrics:
- Authentication events monitoring
- Network traffic pattern analysis
- System resource utilization tracking
- Firewall and IDS/IPS alert monitoring



### Module 2: Configuring SIEM Alerts and Dashboards

Configuration of detection rules for:
- Failed login attempts exceeding thresholds
- Unusual data transfer detection
- Unauthorized access attempts to sensitive files


### Module 3: Analyzing Suspicious Logs

Development of log analysis skills to identify patterns indicating suspicious activities:
- Brute force attack detection
- Data exfiltration identification
- Web application attack recognition

### Module 4: Incident Response Simulation

Implementation of a formal incident response plan following standard methodologies:
- Preparation and identification
- Containment strategies
- Eradication procedures
- Recovery processes
- Documentation and lessons learned


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git for cloning this repository
- At least 8GB of RAM and 20GB of free disk space

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shemaprince123/W8-6110-Security-Monitoring-and-Reporting.git
   cd W8-6110-Security-Monitoring-and-Reporting
   ```

2. Start the lab environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Wait for all services to initialize (1-2 minutes)

### Accessing Lab Components

- Kibana dashboard: http://localhost:5601
- Corporate server SSH: `ssh admin@localhost -p 2222` (password: password)
- Corporate web server: http://localhost:8080

### Running Attack Simulations

```bash
# SSH Brute Force Attack
docker exec -it attacker python3 /scripts/brute_force.py

# Data Exfiltration
docker exec -it attacker python3 /scripts/data_exfiltration.py
```

### Shutting Down

To stop the lab environment:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Elasticsearch Fails to Start**: Increase Docker's memory allocation or reduce memory settings in docker-compose.yml
- **Kibana Cannot Connect**: Ensure Elasticsearch is fully initialized before Kibana attempts to connect
- **Container Restart Issues**: Check Docker logs for specific error messages

## Technologies Used

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) 7.16.3
- Suricata IDS/IPS
- Ubuntu 20.04 (base for most containers)
- Kali Linux (for attacker container)
- Python for attack simulation scripts

## Learning Outcomes

This lab implementation demonstrates proficiency in:
- Designing and deploying containerized security environments
- Configuring SIEM tools for effective security monitoring
- Analyzing logs to detect suspicious activities
- Developing and implementing incident response plans
- Working with industry-standard security tools
